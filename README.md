# Weather-App-
CTS 289 Final Project

## Project Goal:
This is a weather app. A weather app will show you what the weather will be today, tomorrow, and the future. It also will tell you if it is going to rain, thunderstorm, tornado, etc. Knowing the weather in the coming future is very important so that you know what to wear if it is hot, cold, raining, and many more.
Our goal is to make a weather app that can tell you the predictions of the weather that are coming to our daily lives.
